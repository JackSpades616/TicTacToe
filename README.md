Whisper Mode
-------------------------------------

If you want to play with someone in whisper Mode, you only have to take the player to the target and click the target button to get the name of the target into the TextBox in the Config Menu and than click the invite button to start the game.
You can also enter the name of the opponent in the TextBox and invite it.

-------------------------------------
Party and Raid Mode
-------------------------------------

You can play with someone in your party or raid. So you can play Tic Tac Toe over distances. The handling is the same as whisper mode.

-------------------------------------
Guild Mode
-------------------------------------

This is same like the Party Mode but with someone in your guild.



-------------------------------------
Singleplayer Mode
-------------------------------------

You can choose the single player mode by activating the single player checkbox in the configuration. If it is activated the dropdown menu below will be enabled. 
There you can choose if you want to play against yourself or against simple or medium AI. On launch it is set to medium.

We are planning to integrate a hard mode but first things first. ;)
